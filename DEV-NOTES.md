## Using Vite instead of create-react-app

```shell
npm create vite@latest ./ -- --template react
```

## Other Packages

```shell
npm install --legacy--peer-deps @react-three/fiber @react-three/drei maath react-tilt react-vertical-timeline-component @emailjs/browser framer-motion react-router-dom
```

**--legacy--peer-deps**

Can be useed after installing packages with NPM to use an older, less strict method for handling peer dependencies.  
This can be helpful if you encounter compatibility issues, but it might also lead to potential problems and is generally not recommended unless you have no other options.

## Starting the app

```shell
npm run dev
```
